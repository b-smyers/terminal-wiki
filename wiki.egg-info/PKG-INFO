# terminal-wiki

This is a Python script that uses requests and BeautifulSoup modules to fetch and parse information from Wikipedia based on a user-provided search query via the terminal.






## Prerequisites

Prerequisites Before running this script, make sure you have the following modules installed:

    1. requests
    2. BeautifulSoup
You can install these modules using pip:

```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```



## Deployment

To run the script, simply navigate to the directory containing the script and execute the following command in your terminal:


```bash
  python Terminal-Wiki.py
```
The script will then prompt you to enter a search query. Enter the topic you want to search for in Wikipedia and press enter. The script will then fetch and parse the information from the corresponding Wikipedia page and print it to the terminal.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the script:

```
python Terminal-Wiki.py
Enter your search query: python programming
```

The script will then fetch and parse the information from the Python programming page on Wikipedia and print it to the terminal.


Update: I am trying to package this into a snap package, which would enable users to install it on their machines via snap and use it. Felt it is way better of a tool suitable for that kind of environment than running a python script after cloning from GitHub.
